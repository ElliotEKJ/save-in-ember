# Save in Ember Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that adds a “Save in Ember” button next to Dribbble shots.

*Note: This was a personal project. There's already an official, far more fully-featured extension available for Ember.*

## How it works

I've written a [full breakdown](http://casualnotebook.com/posts/lets-breakdown-the-save-in-ember-browser-extension) over on my blog. Simply put, it uses the `emberapp:///import?url={{URL}}` URL scheme.

## How to use it

Requirements:

- Obviously, this requires [Ember](http://realmacsoftware.com/). Get a 14 day free trial [here](http://realmacsoftware.com/ember#download).
- “Always enable browser extensions” must be turned on in Ember's preferences.

1. Download and unzip this repo
2. Open the extensions tab in Chrome's preferences
3. Make sure “Developer mode” is checked
4. Drag the folder onto the window
